# TASK-MANAGER

## A Copy of Apps like Trello and Asana used for project managment

This is a project I did in order to learn and practice coding with ReactJS.

I used Hooks and Context instead of Redux.

User can add new lists, add new cards, assign a task to a user, add a due date, add description of a task,
add checklists (subtasks), mark tasks as complete, view all details in a modal, drag and drop cards, drag and drop lists.

I'm working on setting up a database and user authentification.

There are still some minor bugs to be fixed. Dragging lists causes some weird behavior.
