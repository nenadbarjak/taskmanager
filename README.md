# TASK-MANAGER

## A Copy of Apps like Trello and Asana used for project managment

This is a project I did in order to learn and practice coding with ReactJS.

I used Hooks and Context instead of Redux.

User can add new lists, add new cards, assign a task to a user, add a due date, add description of a task,
add checklists (subtasks), mark tasks as complete, view all details in a modal, drag and drop cards, drag and drop lists.

You can login using the following credentials: email: nenad@example.com, password: test1234 or create a new account using a dummy email.
